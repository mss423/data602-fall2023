# DATA602 Repository
Welcome to DATA/MSML602 - Introduction to Data Science! This is our course repository for all programming related assignments and materials.

Over the course of the semester, you will work with a variety of software packages, including Python Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, and others. Installing those packages and getting started can often be a hassle because of software dependencies, so we instead provide the assignments as *Google CoLab notebooks*.

For those unfamiliar with GitHub, below is some basic information about the platform.

### GitHub

Git is one of the most widely used version control management systems today, and invaluable when working in a team. GitHub is a web-based hosting service built around git -- it supports hosting git repositories, user management, etc. There are other similar services, e.g., bitbucket.

We will use GitHub to distribute the assignments, and other class materials. Our use of git/github for the class will be minimal; however, we encourage you to use it for collaboration for your class project, or for other classes.

Just Cloning the Class Repository

You don't need a GitHub account for just cloning the class repository. From the commandline, just do:

git clone https://github.com/mss423/data602-fall2023.git

You can do git pull (from within the data602-fall2023 directory) to fetch the newly added material.

NOTE: If you are having trouble installing git, you can just download the files instead (as a zipfile), although updating may become tedious.

### Google CoLab and Notebook Basics

The programming assignments will distributed to be run using *Google CoLab*. These environments give you access to all the computational resources needed to complete the programs without having to install any dependencies / packages to your local machines.
